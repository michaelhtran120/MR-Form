# MaRecipe SPA

## About

MaRecipe is an application that is geared towards fitness and cooking enthusiasts as it allows users to save recipes, but also provide the macros per serving. Like other recipe applications, users would input recipe details such as ingredients, instructions, etc. But the key difference here is that MaRecipe requires users to input the macros per ingredient. The application then will provide a breakdown of the calories and macros per serving for the user.

This application is a small part of a bigger planned project.

## For Developers & Individuals Interested In Testing

If you would like to help, please note that I am using json-server for back-end at the moment.

Also using VScodes Live Sass Compiler and do not have Sass dependencies installed.

I am currently looking into how I can host the fake backend I built using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) / [json-server-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server-auth)

If you would like to get started, please clone this repository.
You will need two terminal windows open, one for the MaRecipe application and another for initialize the json-server-auth.
1. In first terminal, type 'npm start'
2. In second terminal, type 'npm run server-auth'
3. You should now be able to access the application via localhost.

### Using the Application
1. You can sign up and explore features.
2. You can use the following credentials to log in.
    1. Email: admin@admin.com
    2. Password: admin1



## Retrospect

My goal in developing this project was to learn Typescript, Jest and Redux. It took some time to understand the fundamentals while building this project, but I am grateful for learning the fundamentals and want to explore these in a bigger application.

Since this is a small part of a bigger project, I can see how I would better structure the code to fit a bigger application.
